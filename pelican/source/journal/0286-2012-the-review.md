It's late since it's 2013 already. But who cares. I don't celebrate new year. At
least that Dec 31st to Jan 1st thing. My new year is every August 13th, because
that's the date I was born.

Anyway, 2012. It was a great year for me. I spent the first halt in Kuala Lumpur - Malaysia,
and the other half in Jakarta - Indonesia. Yes after in 2011 I decided to move to Malaysia,
I moved out. I had offers from Singapore, but I decided I wanted to work in Jakarta.
Lots of reasons, but the big one is, I believe Jakarta startup scene is bigger,
and I'll miss a lot by not working in Jakarta. Of course I still have
my dreams to live abroad. That brings us the next point ...

My wife got pregnant, after 2 years trying. That's probably the best thing happened to me in 2012.
And she got pregnant less than a month after we moved back to Jakarta. God's way
to tell that moving back is the better decission? your call. All I can say is my life
got better.

So yeah, I'm having a baby in 4 months. With that condition, I won't move abroad again in maybe two years.
And as I said before, I believe in Jakarta startup scene. And I have some projects
with some friends that'll keep me busy, learning stuff.

Anyway, I hope you enjoyed your 2012, because I did.
